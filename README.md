# Project: EPL Result Classification

## Wonseok choi

The goal of the project is to predict full-time result of the English Premier League match.

I used RandomForestClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier to compare the F1_score of the 2 models. Each score were 0.657 and 0.632. The RandomForestClassifier performed better than the KNeighborsClassifier on this dataset.
